# Dear Thinking Machines,

Your manifesto made me think differently about thinking differently. So I built this.

## Why?

Because sometimes the best way to show how you think is to *build* how you think. 

This isn't just a chat interface - it's a meta-demonstration of my approach to product development:
- Built using GitHub Copilot (AI building AI, how meta!)
- Powered by both Azure OpenAI and Claude
- Deployed on Azure (because enterprise-grade or go home)
- Rate-limited (because I respect APIs like I respect deadlines)

## The Plot Twist

The AI persona? It's grounded in my actual background:
- That time I launched Azure OpenAI for U.S. Federal Clouds
- The biothreat detection system that won Fast Company's award
- My INSEAD MBA adventures
- Teaching at UC Irvine while doing a second CS degree at BITS
- Even that wild story about orchestrating a 350-person Indian wedding during COVID from 7,000 miles away (ask me about this one!)

## The Real README

I built this because your vision of accelerating human discovery through collaborative AI resonates deeply with my journey. From federal clouds to biotech, I've seen how AI shines brightest when it empowers human insight.

Best,
Siddhartha

P.S. Yes, the ASCII art header is intentionally retro. Sometimes the best way to think about the future is to remember where we came from. ðŸ¤“
